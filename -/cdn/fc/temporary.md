# 8H & H+ Summer Homework Assignment


Welcome to 8H & H+ English! We’re excited for a great year with you (after a nice, long, relaxing summer). This summer’s assignment helps lead into our first semester. It addresses perspective and characterization in crime fiction and detective works.

While the assignments themselves only require you to read one novel and four short stories, we expect you to read more than that. Please take this opportunity to explore your reading interests. Use your MAP scores to find your Lexile levels, and visit a site like lexile.com, scholastic.com, or bookfinder.com for suggestions. In general, you all have reading levels that will allow you to read just about any adult books you’d like. So, you can also utilize amazon.com, Barnes & Noble, & The New York Times bestseller lists (past and current) for suggestions as well.

You will have two assignments. You must complete both. Together, they are worth 10% of your first monthly score. They are due one week after the day school starts. Furthermore, the concepts of point of view and characterization are an important part of the first half of the semester. You will be expected to use these readings and may even be tested on them.

If you have any questions this summer, you can contact Mr. Brigham (jasonbrigham09@gmail.com) for H+ or Mr. Laverriere (mlaverriere@hotmail.com) for H, but in general, you should have all the information you need in this packet.

## Objectives:
- Assignment 1 – The Crimes We Read: Students will analyze point of view and story elements to develop a better understanding of the effect of perspective in literature.

- Assignment 2 – The Characterization of Detectives: Students will analyze the characterization of a detective in both written and film works to develop a strong understanding of the art of character.

## Assignment 1 – The Crimes We Read

The first half of the 8th grade semester will be devoted to the art of suspense. In this unit, we will study famous horror stories. To prepare you for this, the first part of your summer homework requires you to read a crime story. Why crime, if we’ll be studying horror? Well, it’s all about perspective. We want you to read it to consider point of view and the effect on plot. Think about the differences between what you might consider a horror story and a crime (or maybe mystery) story. Often, the most powerful difference is that a horror story is told by the “victim” and a crime story by the criminal or a detective.

### Part 1: Choose a novel.
There are suggestions on the next page. As you read, consider the effect that point of view has on the story. Be ready to discuss this when you come to class. (Note: if you are easily scared, read the reviews to make sure you read a book that isn’t too scary! Your English homework shouldn’t give you nightmares! (At least, not because of the content of it!)

### Part 2: Complete one of the following activities for your book.

#### __Digital:__
- Sweded “book trailer” – Essentially this is like a movie trailer, only you will create one for the book. It is low-budget, meaning you shouldn’t buy anything for it. Just use whatever you have laying around the house. If this still doesn’t make sense, you can type in “sweded movies” on Youtube or Youku.
- An infographic - for your crime fiction novel it must be done in some way that shows research and understanding of the novel (you could follow some of these examples for a specific story: [follow link](http://furthr.co.uk/this-infographic-by-kurt-vonnegut-explains-how-to-shape-your-story/), [follow link](https://bacirc.edublogs.org/2013/11/06/why-reading-is-dangerous-infographic/)). You can easily research similar crime stories and compare and contrast them.

#### __Creative:__
- A graphic novel chapter with an alternate ending to your story. There should be a minimum of fifteen well-drawn and well-planned panels (as in 15 squares). If you are not gifted in drawing, no problem – pick a different option! Ensure that the new ending remains true to the elements of the story.
- You can create a visual advertisement for your story, almost like a movie poster. You must include the following however: summary of the main idea or plot, main character analysis (how would you describe the character and his or her changes throughout the story), theme, personal review/recommendation (& explanation of why you did or did not enjoy the book!), & beautiful (give your best effort) color illustrations.

#### __Traditional:__
- You may write an alternate ending to your novel. This should be at least one page long and remain true to the original elements of the story.
- You can write an analysis of one specific (higher level) element of a story (i.e. theme, the protagonist’s development, a historical analysis of the context of the story…). This should be at least 750 words long and use specific text evidence with citations. (No, long block quotes cannot make up most of the 750 words.)

## Suggested Crime Fiction Reading List
The following are examples of some (mostly) level-appropriate crime novels which could be used for your summer homework. These novels are merely suggestions and do NOT have to be used. You are free to choose your own. On the list below you will see the title, author, and Lexile level. The Lexile level will tell you about the complexity of the book.


- Strangers on a Train – Patricia Highsmith `(710)`
- Fatherland – Robert Harris `(720)`
- The Murder of Roger Ackroyd – Agatha Christie `(720)`
- The Maltese Falcon – Dashiell Hammett `(760)`
- True Grit – Charles Portis `(800)`

- Misery – Stephen King `(860)`
- The Nine Tailors – Dorothy Sayers `(910)`
- The Secret Agent – Joseph Conrad `(1020)`

## Assignment 2 – The Character of the Great Detective
First, read the background for your assignment. You are expected to be familiar with the background knowledge when you come to class next semester, so do not just skip it and go to the assignment. (If need be, consider the background reading an assignment as well.)

### Background:
At this point in your middle school career, you’ve studied characterization more than once. You should be familiar with the following terms to describe characterization: flat1, round2, static3, dynamic4 (and if not, utilize the footnotes).

There is a character type that seemingly defies these rules however—the detective. Despite appearing to be the protagonist, the detective does not necessarily show development, which put them into the static category. They may not always even seem to be round.

The technical reason for this is that in a detective story, the detective is not a traditional protagonist, but instead, they are often a tool of narration. Think about a detective story you might know. How much of the plot develops through the dialogue or actions of the detective? Usually most of it. That is the start of why a detective is such a strange and complicated character. (It is even more complicated than this, but we can talk more during the school year!)

As a result, you cannot usually analyze the characterization of a detective in the course of one short story or even novel. You must look at them as a collection or series. So, that is what we are asking you to do as a part of your summer homework.



- Flat characters are what we consider “two-dimensional”. We know very little about them, and as characters, they are quite plain. Due to this, we tend to feel less concern for these characters.

- Round characters are more developed. We know more about these characters, such as their backgrounds and motivations. As a result of this, we tend to care more about these characters.

- Static characters do not change throughout a story. In other words, they do not “develop”.

- Dynamic characters do change throughout the story, so we can analyze their development.

Please note that this is not the only way you will analyze the character of Sherlock Holmes in particular, as you will revisit him later in the year. So, please pay detailed attention to him.

## Assignment:
As one of the most famous literary canons, Sherlock Holmes has been the inspiration for plenty of stories, series, and plays. For your summer homework, we would like you to read four original Sherlock Holmes stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Then, we would like you to watch a movie or TV show that uses the character of Sherlock Holmes in them.

#### __Assignment Specifics:__
- Read four of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes stories. The two listed on the next page are required. You may choose the last two.
- Watch a modern version of Sherlock Holmes.
- Create a product that explains and compares the analysis of the characterization of Sherlock Holmes in the original works and the modern film version.

### Stories
#### __Required:__
- “A Scandal in Bohemia” -
https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/A_Scandal_in_Bohemia
- “The Adventure of the Speckled Band” -
https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Adventure_of_the_Speckled_Band

#### __Optional (Choose 2):__
- [http://www.openculture.com/2015/10/arthur-conan-doyle-names-his-19-favorite-sherlock-holmes-stories](http://www.openculture.com/2015/10/arthur-conan-doyle-names-his-19-favorite-sherlock-holmes-stories.html)

Note: If for some reason the links above do not work, you can easily search the stories yourself. You must read the original, not abridged versions.

### Film Versions
You only need to choose one of these (for the TV series, you may need to watch more than one episode to create your product):
#### __Movies:__
- Sherlock Holmes (2009)
- Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows (2011)
- The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson: The Hound of the Baskervilles (1981)
#### __TV:__
- Sherlock Holmes (BBC, 1960)
- Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson (1979 - 1980)
- Sherlock (BBC 2009 – now) [*](#footnotequery_If_you_choose_a_TV_se)
- Elementary (CBS 2012 – now) [*](#footnotequery_If_you_choose_a_TV_se)

<p id="footnotequery_If_you_choose_a_TV_se">* If you choose a TV series, it’s highly suggested you choose one of these more modern takes.</p>


### Products
Just as with your crime fiction assignment, you may choose from a large array of ways to display your comparative analysis.

Any of these would work:
- a website (wix.com lets you make them for free)
- an infographic
- a vlog or video
- a blog
- a podcast
- a magazine article
- an essay
- You can also use the product lists from assignment one for inspiration, but make sure you choose a different product than the first assignment. Also, note that the objective is slightly different, so you may have to alter it a little bit.

In general, the amount of effort for this should be the equivalent to the writing of an essay for class. Luckily, the time you would usually spend doing research gets to be spent watching a version of Sherlock Holmes! The planning, writing, and editing should be about the same.
