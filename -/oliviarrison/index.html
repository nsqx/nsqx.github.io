      <desc txt para-start>As the end of the semester drew near, members of the Immortal Fam began to tease at the new central focus of the group – the Oliviarrison ship, starring Olivia and Harrison. They are the perfect duo – Harry is short and dumb, while he sees the opposite in Olivia. He decides that they were made for each other, and expressed interest. <span bracketus>He didn't, but we all knew his inner thoughts and desires.</span>
      </desc><desc txt>One day, I generated a piece of fanfiction concerning the two using artificial intelligence and shared it with le pep, and Bill became extremely obsessed and thirsty over the idea of Oliviarisson fanfic. After many hours, he came up with <i classic-font quote>the Oliviarrison Fanfiction challenge</i> – a poorly disguised excuse for a chance to read at mild sex scenes and intricate romantic plot.
      </desc><desc txt>The entirety of Le Fam (excluding a few members) were all extremely excited to participate in this challenge and get a chance to poke fun at Harryboi at a <q>deeper</q> level. You could call this harassment, but I'll disagree. I call this art.

        Bill then rubric'd, as one does, and left us to it.

        She was the most beautiful girl I had ever seen. Blonde hair, blue eyes, a smile full of sunshine. Well, that didn’t work too well, she apparently looked down on me because I apparently “stalked her and ate her pasta”? Really I was honestly disappointed I really thought there was a sort of invisible consent that was given. Well I settled for the second best thing available to me, Olivia. With a name resembling the olives that I choked on in second grade and beady eyes reminiscent of those shiny stones in Thanos’ rock collection. When I asked her out she immediately accepted and fainted on the spot leaving me disgruntled. However the rough start, our relationship progressed smoothly and we soon became drug dealers. A totally perfect duo, we were. Scamming poor children into buying our mashed infinity stones in the morning and snorting crack under the omniscient gaze of the moon in the evening, life was bliss. On our wedding, we had intercourse while high. Then it flew away like a strip of paper caught in the cruel winter wind. She died. A car crash. Right. In. Front. Of. Me. But don’t worry I had a picture of her and and put it into a body pillow. Now fast forward 2 months, I stay huddled whispering manically in front of a screen of anime cat maids holding my Olivia body pillow in a dark dusty moldy room in the sahara desert, beating this piece of beef. The End.</p>

        It was the day. Harrison had finally turned 18. He can finally stop imagining about it and stop pleasuring himself to the thought of a very special women. Olivia. The love of his life, together since sixth grade. They were together at that moment, in a hotel, just waiting for midnight. They had already done their “preparations”. The second it hit 12 AM, they turned off their phones, and without a word, got under the blankets. God knows what they did under there, but Harrison surely was great at it. You could only hear the sounds of Olivia moaning as she succumbed to the greatness of Harrison’s erect “pleasuring device”. His size was no comparison to anyone else, having the ability to make anyone orgasm. The smell of scented candles filled the air, and romantic music with the occasional moan was the only thing audible. On and on they went, until the sun was rising. This continued on and on nearly every single night.</p><p txt>
        However, their happiness would not last. In just three years time, World War III had started after the assassination of Ferdinand Franz. This caused great tensions in Europe, and soon, America, where Harrison lived with his wife, Olivia, and four children. However, as many places did not have enough to fight the devastating war, after only four months since the declaration of the war, impressment rules were relaxed, and Harrison was among the first batch to get forced to go to the military. There was nothing Harrison could do except to watch the tears drip down Olivia’s face as they said goodbye to each other, and the four children he would miss so greatly, and the other one on the way. Harrison did not receive any training, as everyone was rushing to get more soldiers. He went into war with little to no experience, and he had little contact to the outside world and of course his beloved Olivia. During a great battle, the army with Harrison in it had been forced to go under radio silence. </p>
        <p txt para-start>No communication during this battle. Olivia could only anxiously wait and hope that he would make it out of it alive. However, Olivia soon started feeling contractions. After going to the hospital, she fortunately wasn’t going through labor. She had to wait until Harrison arrived back. She had to. </p><p txt>
        During this time, Harrison was fighting for his life. As he watched his friends and fellow soldiers fall to their death on the battlefield, he started wondering if he would make it out alive. Then he thought of Olivia, and he felt a little something in between his legs. This distracted him, and he was shot in the right leg. He was immediately rushed to the medic, where they slowly and painfully disinfected him. They realized that his situation was unfortunately worsening, and sent him back to his home to the hospital. Even in his weak state of mind, he was extremely happy, knowing that he would still live and see his Olivia. However, as he got back to the hospital, his leg was severely infected. Olivia visited him, and wanted to pull off his pants and start getting dirty with him, but she couldn’t. She began to worry, as it seemed that the infection was pretty bad. In the end, after many worrisome days and nights, Harrison had to get an amputation. Just about when he got on his wheelchair, Olivia started feeling contractions again. They rushed to the hospital, and she delivered their fifth child. Harrison named him Oliver, after Olivia and after the olive branch, a symbol of peace and tranquility. </p><p txt>
        After everything was settled, they got back on the bed again. “Oh! You definitely haven’t lost your power. Oh my! Have you gotten longer?” Those were the desperate words of an overwhelmed Olivia as Harrison drove through her. Only a week after Harrisons arrival, they would be expecting their sixth child. In the end, they would have twelve children in total, but did not stop making love until Harrison truly could not do anything. The happy couple lived a long prosperous life, both dying on the same day, at the age of 105. </p>

            Another	day	comes	by	in	a	small	neighborhood	in	the	city	of	Shanghai,	China.	Near	the	road there	sits	a	park,	and	in	that	park	sits	a	very	steamed	young	man.	May	his	age	be	hidden,	but	he is	very young	- to	say	the	least.	The	age	of	which	he	still	hasn’t	found	the	balance	between	testosterone	and	normality	of	life.	His	name	is	Harrison.	Harrison	stands	under	the	tree,	waiting	for	her	to	come.
          </p>
          <p txt>Her,	being	Olivia.</p>
          <p txt>As	Harry	slowly	wallowed	in	the	shade	of	the	large	tree	at	the	center	of	said park,	he	begins	to	            recount	his	encounters	with	said	woman	- Olivia.</p>
          <p txt>Jesus.	He	thought.	She	would	be	the	most	beautiful	person	I	have	ever	met.</p>
          <p txt><i>Surely,	she	would	be	the	most	beautiful	person	I	have	ever	met.	I	couldn’t	even	settle	to	my	
            status	quo	when	that	shortie	Yeena	abandoned	me.	She	helped	me	become	a	man	again.	Wasn’t	it	only	
            a	few	years	ago	that	I	first	met	her?	Damn,	how	did	I	not	recognize	her	beauty,	and	only	at	this	year’s	
            prom	did	I	ask	her	to	be	my	partner?	What	a	stupid	boy	I	was.	But	I	am	no	longer,	because	of	that	sweet,	
            young	Rosie-cheeked	girl,	my	dear	Livy.</i></p>
          <p txt><i>Oh	well,	that	prom	was	nothing	special.	Only	she	was	in	my	eyes,	and	nothing	else.	It	was	only	
            the	after	party	that	matters,	me	riding	Livy	out	to	Downtown and	savoring	a	few	drinks	with	her	- now	
            that	I	think	of	it,	just	hitting	18	isn’t	a	bad	thing.	But	then	she	went	home	and	told	me	to	hit	her	up	every	
            day	from	now	on.	I	thought	it	was	a	joke	at	the	time,	but	it really	isn’t.	I	proved	that	it	is	not	a	joke	
            myself.</i></p>
          <p txt><i>A	lot	of	things	happened	since	then.	I	accidentally	bumped	into	her	on	the	way	to	school,	and	
            suddenly	I	came	in	contact	with	her	face.	Sadly,	not	on	anywhere	else	but	the	bullseye.	I	think	I	stopped
            thinking	right	then,	looking	at	her	very	startled	eyes	as	she	took	a	deep	breath,	then	another,	then	
            another	one.	And	then	she	kissed	me	back</i></p>
          <p txt><i>I	graduated	from	High	School,	and	Livy	- well	- she’s	a	bit	lacking.	But	I	always	tried	to	help	her	
            with	her	studies.	However	she	would	not	be	in	my	year	of	college	and	obviously,	I	had	to	go	to	Harvard.	
            My	parents’	ambition	for	me	to	become	a	doctor	has	gone	too	far	and	I	really	had	to	go	in	a	week.	Oh,	
            how	the	sadness	will	take	over	me!	If	only	I	can	go	for	her	again	before	her	body	is	reimbursed	by

          <p txt><i>I- i	don’t really	remember	what	happened	that	day,	that	day	I	knew	I	was	going	to	Harvard.	I	was	
            pretty	drunk	that	day.	I	remember	the	punch	that	broke	a	crap	ton	of	plates	as	they	sink	into	the	sharp
            pieces of	porcelain.	Ouch.	Those	plates	hurt	more	than	a	yang	glyph,	since	I- I	would	instantaneously	die.</i></p>

          <p txt>There	was	one	thing	that	stuck	in	his	mind	though.	Something	his	would	never	forget,	not	in	
            any,	ANY	way	would	he	forget	that	kind	smile	and	warm	coffee	she	would	serve	him	when	he	dropped

          <p txt para-start>She	came.          </p>
          <p txt>Just	like	that.          </p>
          <p txt>She	came as	swiftly	as	somebody	of	her	youthful	and	beautiful	age	should	do.	She	wore	a	lovely	
            blue	and	white	checker	shirt	that	seemed	to	gleam	as	the	after-shade of	the	sunshine	poured	on	her,	as	
            it	is	now	nearly	sunset	and	the	sky	grew	purple	and	red	and	sapphire	by	the	second.	She	wore	the	
            enchanting	smell	of	grass,	skincare	and	a	whiff	of	parfum	– all	the	things	that	Harry	never	tried	before.
            Later	that	night,	he	will	be	relieved	of	the	burden	of	one	of	the	things	he	had	never	tried	before,	but	I	
            digress.	Olivia	– Livy	so	that	Harry	calls	her	– came	with	a	trail	of	rainbow-like	energy	to	him,	and	she	
            just	stood	right	in	from	of	Harry,	until	he	finally	made	a	response,	signaling	to	her	to	come	over	to	her	
            and	admire	the	sunset. Their	lips	touch – one	tip <m what/>	after	another.</p>
            <p txt>“How	are	you	today	Livy?”	Harry	said	in	a	comforting	voice,	as	if	he	was	bracing	for	what	is	
              about	to	happen.</p>
              <p txt>“I’m	alright.	What	about	ya?”</p>
            <p txt>“I’m…	ok.	Listen	Livy,	I	got	something	to	tell	you…”            </p>
            <p txt>Harry	took	a	very	large	breath,	and	was	still	plundering	whether	he	should	tell	her	or	not.	Maybe	
              she	will	abandon	her	immediately	in	search	of	someone	else.	Maybe	she	will	cry	so	hard	and	go	do	
              something	stupid	to	herself.	Maybe	HE	will	just	break	down	and	never	recover	from	this. Maybe,	
              maybe…	or	maybe	he	will	just	tell	her	the	truth…	and	all	of	this	will	be	slept	over	and	he	will	get	over	it.</p>
            <p txt>“Livy,	I’m	gonna	go	away	soon.”</p>
            <p txt>“Huh?	Go	away? What	do	you	mean?”</p>
            <p txt>“I…	I’m	leaving	this	place.	I’m	gonna	go	to	Harvard	for..	for	school.”            </p>
            <p txt>Both	of	them	stayed	silent.	For	a	long	time	actually.            </p>
            <p txt>Livy	spoke	again	first,	her	face	and	lips	trembling.	“A- alright.”            </p>
            <p txt>Surprisingly	Livy – and	himself,	Harry	actually	broke	down	before	she	did.	“You…	you	know	it’s	
              NOT	alright!”	Harry	then	started	sobbing	his	heart out.	He	cried	so	hard and	painfully	that	perhaps	the	
              whole	park	could	listen	in	on	his	misery	and	heartbroken	lore.	Occasionally,	he	hit the	tree	beside	him,
              knocking	every	single	aspect	of	his	agony	into	the	bark, which	is	very	painful	I	should	say.</p>
            <p txt>“You	know	it’s	not	alright!	I- I	love	you	Livy.	You	know	that.	You	absolutely fricking know	that
              and	I	can’t	fricking	live	without	being	with	you	everyday.	Oh	I’m	so	attached	to	you	and	I’m	fricking	
              embarrassing	myself-”</p>
            <p txt>He	then	went	to	to	sob	his	life	out	until	the sun	is	bored	of	the	cri	scene	and	almost	went	to	
              witness	another	poor	man	crying	his	guts	out.</p>
            <p txt>“I- I- I can’t	bear	this.	I	would	take	all	my	heart	out	for	you,	Livy,	and	you	gotta	understand	how	
              bad I	am	feeling	right	now.”	He	took	another	deep	breath and- went	back	to	crying	again. It	took	a	bit	of	
              time	and	soothing	from	Olivia,	he	finally	calmed	down.	They	sat	together	under	the	tree,	and	watched	
              the	sunset	completely	disappear.</p>
            <p txt>“Hey.”	Harry	said, the	first	time	in	forever.</p>
            <p txt>“Sup?” Olivia	responded.</p>
            <p txt>“You	wanna	come	down	you	my	apartment?	I’ll	cook	you	something	to	eat.”</p>
            <p txt>“Sure.”</p>
            <p txt>And	as	such	they	went	through	the	park,	then	the	streets,	then	into	Harry’s	apartment.            </p>

        <br>
        <chapter>
          <p txt para-start>When	they	reached	Harrison’s	decrepit	old	home,	there	was	nobody	but	the	deafening	silence	
            awaiting	the	duo.	Harry	told	Livy	to	sit	down	and	he	would	get	her	something	to	chow	down on.	A	few	
            moments	later,	Harry	finally	emerged	from	the	very	small	but	well-lighted	kitchen	and	brought	out	a	
            bowl	of	chicken	soup	for	his	long-awaited	guest.</p>
          <p txt>With	much	gratitude	coming	from	his	guest,	Livy	chowed	down	indeed	on	the	soup,	
            commenting	on the	wonderful	taste	it	has.	Harry	didn’t pay	much	attention	to	this	statement,	instead	
            he	just	murmured	that	is	was	no	matter.</p>
          <p txt>Suddenly, Harry	can	feel	a	slight	tingling from	somewhere	in	his	body.	Such	a	tingling	sensation	
            he	had	not	felt	since	a	young and	untrained age. At	first,	he	thought	it	was	his	brain	that	just	got	to	far	
            into	the	saddening	details	of	his	college	journey.	But	no,	he	was	feeling	pacified	after	the	emotion	
            outbreak	this	afternoon. And	then –</p>
          <p txt>He	looked	down.</p>
          <p txt>Right	down,	at	the	intersection	of	his	shirt	and	pants.</p>
          <p txt>It	was	an	abnormal size.	Totally	absurd,	but	also	totally	mesmerizing.	He	did	not	remember	that	
            his	testosterone	had	helped	him	so	much	in	previous	occasions	of	such	a	thing	happening,	but	no.	He	
            did	not	know	when	this	had	started, how	long	this	became of,	whatever. All	that	he	knew	is	that	
            something	has	happened	to	little	gimmick,	and	it	is- wet?
            </p>
          <p txt>As	he	slowly	maneuvered	him	next	to	Livy, he silently	asked	her	to	– hm. At	first,	both	of	them,	
            like	before,	did	not	speak.	In fact,	neither	of	them	said	a	single	word	until	Olivia,	trembling	with	a	mix	of	
            – is	that	excitement	and	uncertainty?	Yes	it	must	be,	says,	“Do	it.”</p>
          <p txt>Later	that	night,	Livy	was	sitting	on	the	crunchy	bed	that	Harry	owned	with	the	very	anxious
            Harry.	He	had	never	tried	this	before,	and	was	verily concerned	about	the	outcome.	But	at	long	last,	the	
            bell	struck	12	inside	Harry’s	bedroom.	Harry	looked	at	Livy,	Livy	looked	at	Harry.	And	they	both	settled	
            inside	the	rickety	bed. got	under	the	blankets.	Harry	turned	the	air	conditioner	off,	and	they	started	
            cooking	some	burgers.</p>
          <p txt>God	knows	what	they	did	under	the	blankets	that	they	put	on	themselves, but	Harrison	and	Livy,	
            the	first-timers,	surely	were great	at	it.	If	anyone	knocked	up	their	ears	against	the	wall	right	next	to	
            Harry’s	bedroom,	you	sure	can	hear	only	one	thing,	but	that	one	thing	is	very	interesting	how	ever.	You	
            could	only,	that	is, hear	the	sounds	of	Olivia	moaning	as	she	was	knocked	into	the	five	stages	of	grief	
            and	69	stages	of	pleasure altogether, succumbing	to	the	magnificence	and	happiness	of Harrison’s	
            schlong	schtick. Her	counterpart	was	not	feeling	less	of	what	she	is	feeling	on	his	behalf.	The	short	and	
            small	tingling	has	evolved	into	a full-on	throbbing in	every	single	part	of	his	body,	as	he	inadvertently	
            flexed	his	previously	undiscovered	size	on	the	girl	that	he	loved	for	4	years. He	sweated,	he	swore,	he	
            wanted	to	quit	one	time	after	another. His	size	was	of	no	comparison	to	anybody	else,	as	his	brain	
            directed	his	glands	to	release	more	and	more	testosterone.	The	smell	of	yoghurt,	candles,	soap	
            whatsoever	filled	the	incredibly	large	room	compared	to	others	in	Harry’s	possession.	They	wrangled	in

        <p txt para-start>
        It was under that looming, old oak tree, nearing the end of its life as the fire-red leaves fall to the ground. It was under that oak tree, on a chilly Autumn day, as the animals scurry about looking for food before hiding away for the winter. It was under that oak tree, where a lone, low wooden park bench stood.</p>
        <p txt>There sat Harrison, alone, a college student with nothing but school on his mind. His life was nothing special. He had no friends to talk to and had very niche interests. He also had no one of romantic interest. Well, that would change very quickly.</p>
        <p txt>As he sat on the bench, pondering about the dietary composition of cheesecake and the electron configuration of materials in piss, he saw a woman walk by. He was planning to resume his daydream, but he looked up again. He looked at her waves of hair, at the way the sunset light cast itself onto her side. Then, their eyes met, and Harry's heart lept.</p>
        <p txt><i>That must be the most beautiful girl I've ever seen. What am I feeling? I've never felt this emotion for anyone before.</i></p>
        <p txt>They held their gaze. Harry's eyes quivered, and he finally looked down at the floor as he felt the color creep up his cheeks. He could feel the mutual attraction. He stood up from the bench and walked towards her, deciding to introduce himself.</p>
        <p txt><q>Hey there.</q></p>
        <p txt><q>Hi, I'm Olivia.</q></p>
        <p txt>The rest was all a blur to Harry. Harry learned that Olivia was a transfer student to Harry's school, but the rest was all a blur. They gradually grew closer and closer, helping out each other with homework and studying and playing video games and going to parties together. They passed the semester together, bumping into each other <q>accidentally</q> in the corridors to have an excuse to express their relationship. Half the semester sped by. </p>
        <p><span fakecontrol><br><hr block/><br></span></p><p txt>Finally one day, Harrison decided to do it. He took a deep breath, and walked towards Olivia. When she caught sight of him, she smiled. Harry smiled back, and she pulled her into a hug. "Harry," she said, "You look really handsome." Harry bled from the nose as Olivia felt his muscular upper arms around her. "Olivia," he whispered, leaning down to her ear, "You're beautiful." She blushed as she felt his face so close to hers. She ran her fingers through his hair. "Wanna come over to mine after school?" Harry asked Olivia, smiling a little. "Sure, let's do homework together" Olivia responded, giggling.</p>

        <p txt>They headed out the library and hitched a ride to Harry's apartment. He showed her the huge apartment he rented in the same building as Charlie and Lola. They played with Harry's cat Lulu, a pure white Persian. Soon, they both started getting tired, and they went up to Harry's bedroom. They got undressed, and lay down. Harry kept his face close to her face, and kissed her. "Harry," she said, gently pulling on his hair, "I just want to say..." He was distracted by the tickle in his armpit. "What?" he asked. "I just wanted to say, that you're handsome and you smell good" Olivia smiled. "Gee, thanks, Liv" "Whatever, just you know, I like the fact that you're my boyfriend." Harry blushed as he kissed her one last time before heading to bed. Olivia followed him, but laid on his right side, facing the wall. Her head fell onto his arm, which she held close to her. They fell asleep quickly.</p>

        <p txt>Harry woke up the next day, lying on his back. He rolled over, and found Olivia had left a little note on his pillow. He picked it up, and read the words.</p>

        <p txt style="line-height: 1rem;"><br><m quoter>Harry,<br><m quoter><br></m><m quoter><br></m><br></m>
          <m quoter>I really hope we can do this again.<br><br></m><m quoter><br></m><m quoter><br></m>

          <m quoter>-Olivia<br></m><br></p>

        <p txt>Harry smiled, and put the note back down. He ate his breakfast, dressed, and left his apartment.

        At school, he got bullied yet again for being short. He was beat up by Bill. Harry was miserable for rest of the school day, and trudged back to his apartment, petting his cat. 

        Then, he received a text from Olivia. Just the thought of her cheered up Harry, making him happy. The text read, "Don't take those stupid bullies seriously". He smiled, and replied.</p>

        <p txt style="line-height: 1rem;"><br><m quoter>Olivia,<br><m quoter><br></m><m quoter><br></m><br></m>

          <m quoter>Come over after dinner. I can barely contain my excitement.<br><br></m><m quoter><br></m><m quoter><br></m>

          <m quoter>-Harry<br></m><br></p>

        <p txt>After Harry watched soccer on TV for an hour, he heard a knock at the door. "Hey, lookee here, there's someone at my door" Harry opened the door. "Hiii, Harry" Olivia said. He nervously smiled at her. "I'm so excited, I just can't hide it. Come on in."</p>

        <p txt>Harry shut the door as Olivia walked in. Olivia was beautiful, with a short brown dress and a subtle crop-top. They kissed each other passionately and sat on the couch. Olivia decided to say it. "Wanna make love?" "Yes!", Harry responded.<br>
        They undressed, and went to the bedroom. They kissed and passionately rubbed each other's bodies. Harry stuffed his long cock down Olivia. It got intense and Harry came. Then, they both came again. They climaxed, and waited for Olivia's spasm to subside.
        They made love twice, which was only normal for Olivia, who was so incredibly turned on. 
        "Olivia," Harry asked after he came, "Would you..." but she already had mouthful of sperm. "Not like that." She proceeded to spurt it directly in his face. Olivia only smiled. "Yes, like that" Harry said to himself. I want to make her feel like that all the time. Soon, after her spasm subsided, Olivia finally finished. She masturbated Harry into his final ejaculation. They finished off with some sloppy sex.</p>

        <p txt>Harry watched some cartoons, as Olivia showered. She came back, and rested in Harry's lap, nuzzling her face against his crotch. After a while, she took a bite of her mango, as Harry munched on his chicken. "I hope we can do it again soon. Is it ok if we do? Can we do it whenever we want? Like, whenever we get horny? I'd love to do it as often as I want."</p>

        <p txt>Harry chuckled.</p>
