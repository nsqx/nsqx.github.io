When <span class="name2">:2</span> reveals she has her own mouth fetish he refuses to give her blow-job. When <span class="name2">:2</span> asks <span class="name1">:1</span> to tell her what he loves the most about her he keeps quiet. <span class="name2">:2</span> then lies and says she loves <span class="name1">:1</span>'s dick but <span class="name1">:1</span> doesn't care, he wants his woman. He grabs her by her hair and pulls her to his cock. He uses her moans to guide her to suck his dick. He stops her by kissing her lips. He pulls out of her mouth and nods. He flips her over and shoves his dick in her cum soaked pussy. She cries out in pleasure as he fucks her harder and harder. He presses her down so that her knees are on the bed. He grabs the back of her head and pulls her to his dick. Her eyes open in confusion as she sees his dick in her mouth. She moans softly as he fucks her mouth, coating her tongue with his cum. He lays her down on the bed and wraps her legs around his waist. He begins to kiss her again and again and cum leaks out of <span class="name2">:2</span>'s mouth

    Another	day	comes	by	in	a	small	neighborhood	in	the	city	of	Shanghai,	China.	Near	the	road there	sits	a	park,	and	in	that	park	sits	a	very	steamed	young	man.	May	his	age	be	hidden,	but	he is	very young	- to	say	the	least.	The	age	of	which	he	still	hasn’t	found	the	balance	between	testosterone	and	normality	of	life.	His	name	is	<span class="name1">:1</span>.	<span class="name1">:1</span>	stands	under	the	tree,	waiting	for	her	to	come.
    </h5>
    <h5 txt>Her,	being	<span class="name2">:2</span>.</h5>
    <h5 txt>As	<span class="name1v2">:1</span>	slowly	wallowed	in	the	shade	of	the	large	tree	at	the	center	of	said park,	he	begins	to	            recount	his	encounters	with	said	woman	- <span class="name2">:2</span>.</h5>
    <h5 txt>Jesus.	He	thought.	She	would	be	the	most	beautiful	person	I	have	ever	met.</h5>
    <h5 txt><i>Surely,	she	would	be	the	most	beautiful	person	I	have	ever	met.	I	couldn’t	even	settle	to	my	
    status	quo	when	that	shortie	Yeena	abandoned	me.	She	helped	me	become	a	man	again.	Wasn’t	it	only	
    a	few	years	ago	that	I	first	met	her?	Damn,	how	did	I	not	recognize	her	beauty,	and	only	at	this	year’s	
    prom	did	I	ask	her	to	be	my	partner?	What	a	stupid	boy	I	was.	But	I	am	no	longer,	because	of	that	sweet,	
    young	Rosie-cheeked	girl,	my	dear	<span class="name2v2">:2</span>.</i></h5>
    <h5 txt><i>Oh	well,	that	prom	was	nothing	special.	Only	she	was	in	my	eyes,	and	nothing	else.	It	was	only	
    the	after	party	that	matters,	me	riding	<span class="name2v2">:2</span>	out	to	Downtown and	savoring	a	few	drinks	with	her	- now	
    that	I	think	of	it,	just	hitting	18	isn’t	a	bad	thing.	But	then	she	went	home	and	told	me	to	hit	her	up	every	
    day	from	now	on.	I	thought	it	was	a	joke	at	the	time,	but	it really	isn’t.	I	proved	that	it	is	not	a	joke	
    myself.</i></h5>
    <h5 txt><i>A	lot	of	things	happened	since	then.	I	accidentally	bumped	into	her	on	the	way	to	school,	and	
    suddenly	I	came	in	contact	with	her	face.	Sadly,	not	on	anywhere	else	but	the	bullseye.	I	think	I	stopped
    thinking	right	then,	looking	at	her	very	startled	eyes	as	she	took	a	deep	breath,	then	another,	then	
    another	one.	And	then	she	kissed	me	back</i></h5>
    <h5 txt><i>I	graduated	from	High	School,	and	<span class="name2v2">:2</span>	- well	- she’s	a	bit	lacking.	But	I	always	tried	to	help	her

    <h5 txt para-start>She	came.          </h5>
    <h5 txt>Just	like	that.          </h5>
    <h5 txt>She	came as	swiftly	as	somebody	of	her	youthful	and	beautiful	age	should	do.	She	wore	a	lovely	
    blue	and	white	checker	shirt	that	seemed	to	gleam	as	the	after-shade of	the	sunshine	poured	on	her,	as	
    it	is	now	nearly	sunset	and	the	sky	grew	purple	and	red	and	sapphire	by	the	second.	She	wore	the	
    enchanting	smell	of	grass,	skincare	and	a	whiff	of	parfum	– all	the	things	that	<span class="name1v2">:1</span>	never	tried	before.
    Later	that	night,	he	will	be	relieved	of	the	burden	of	one	of	the	things	he	had	never	tried	before,	but	I	
    digress.	<span class="name2">:2</span>	– <span class="name2v2">:2</span>	so	that	<span class="name1v2">:1</span>	calls	her	– came	with	a	trail	of	rainbow-like	energy	to	him,	and	she	
    just	stood	right	in	from	of	<span class="name1v2">:1</span>,	until	he	finally	made	a	response,	signaling	to	her	to	come	over	to	her	
    and	admire	the	sunset. Their	lips	touch – one	tip <m what/>	after	another.</h5>
    <h5 txt>“How	are	you	today	<span class="name2v2">:2</span>?”	<span class="name1v2">:1</span>	said	in	a	comforting	voice,	as	if	he	was	bracing	for	what	is	
        about	to	happen.</h5>
        <h5 txt>“I’m	alright.	What	about	ya?”</h5>
    <h5 txt>“I’m…	ok.	Listen	<span class="name2v2">:2</span>,	I	got	something	to	tell	you…”            </h5>
    <h5 txt><span class="name1v2">:1</span>	took	a	very	large	breath,	and	was	still	plundering	whether	he	should	tell	her	or	not.	Maybe	
        she	will	abandon	her	immediately	in	search	of	someone	else.	Maybe	she	will	cry	so	hard	and	go	do	
        something	stupid	to	herself.	Maybe	HE	will	just	break	down	and	never	recover	from	this. Maybe,	
        maybe…	or	maybe	he	will	just	tell	her	the	truth…	and	all	of	this	will	be	slept	over	and	he	will	get	over	it.</h5>
    <h5 txt>“<span class="name2v2">:2</span>,	I’m	gonna	go	away	soon.”</h5>
    <h5 txt>“Huh?	Go	away? What	do	you	mean?”</h5>
    <h5 txt>“I…	I’m	leaving	this	place.	I’m	gonna	go	to	Harvard	for..	for	school.”            </h5>
    <h5 txt>Both	of	them	stayed	silent.	For	a	long	time	actually.            </h5>
    <h5 txt><span class="name2v2">:2</span>	spoke	again	first,	her	face	and	lips	trembling.	“A- alright.”            </h5>
    <h5 txt>Surprisingly	<span class="name2v2">:2</span> – and	himself,	<span class="name1v2">:1</span>	actually	broke	down	before	she	did.	“You…	you	know	it’s	
        NOT	alright!”	<span class="name1v2">:1</span>	then	started	sobbing	his	heart out.	He	cried	so	hard and	painfully	that	perhaps	the	
        whole	park	could	listen	in	on	his	misery	and	heartbroken	lore.	Occasionally,	he	hit the	tree	beside	him,
        knocking	every	single	aspect	of	his	agony	into	the	bark, which	is	very	painful	I	should	say.</h5>
    <h5 txt>“You	know	it’s	not	alright!	I- I	love	you	<span class="name2v2">:2</span>.	You	know	that.	You	absolutely fricking know	that
        and	I	can’t	fricking	<span class="name2v2">:2</span>e	without	being	with	you	everyday.	Oh	I’m	so	attached	to	you	and	I’m	fricking	
        embarrassing	myself-”</h5>
    <h5 txt>He	then	went	to	to	sob	his	life	out	until	the sun	is	bored	of	the	cri	scene	and	almost	went	to	
        witness	another	poor	man	crying	his	guts	out.</h5>
    <h5 txt>“I- I- I can’t	bear	this.	I	would	take	all	my	heart	out	for	you,	<span class="name2v2">:2</span>,	and	you	gotta	understand	how	
        bad I	am	feeling	right	now.”	He	took	another	deep	breath and- went	back	to	crying	again. It	took	a	bit	of	
        time	and	soothing	from	<span class="name2">:2</span>,	he	finally	calmed	down.	They	sat	together	under	the	tree,	and	watched	
        the	sunset	completely	disappear.</h5>
    <h5 txt>“Hey.”	<span class="name1v2">:1</span>	said, the	first	time	in	forever.</h5>
    <h5 txt>“Sup?” <span class="name2">:2</span>	responded.</h5>
    <h5 txt>“You	wanna	come	down	you	my	apartment?	I’ll	cook	you	something	to	eat.”</h5>
    <h5 txt>“Sure.”</h5>
    <h5 txt>And	as	such	they	went	through	the	park,	then	the	streets,	then	into	<span class="name1v2">:1</span>’s	apartment.            </h5>
</chapter>
<h5 block>***</h5>

<chapter>
    <h5 txt para-start>When	they	reached	<span class="name1">:1</span>’s	decrepit	old	home,	there	was	nobody	but	the	deafening	silence	
    awaiting	the	duo.	<span class="name1v2">:1</span>	told	<span class="name2v2">:2</span>	to	sit	down	and	he	would	get	her	something	to	chow	down on.	A	few	
    moments	later,	<span class="name1v2">:1</span>	finally	emerged	from	the	very	small	but	well-lighted	kitchen	and	brought	out	a	
    bowl	of	chicken	soup	for	his	long-awaited	guest.</h5>
    <h5 txt>With	much	gratitude	coming	from	his	guest,	<span class="name2v2">:2</span>	chowed	down	indeed	on	the	soup,	
    commenting	on the	wonderful	taste	it	has.	<span class="name1v2">:1</span>	didn’t pay	much	attention	to	this	statement,	instead	
    he	just	murmured	that	is	was	no	matter.</h5>
    <h5 txt>Suddenly, <span class="name1v2">:1</span>	can	feel	a	slight	tingling from	somewhere	in	his	body.	Such	a	tingling	sensation	
    he	had	not	felt	since	a	young and	untrained age. At	first,	he	thought	it	was	his	brain	that	just	got	to	far	
    into	the	saddening	details	of	his	college	journey.	But	no,	he	was	feeling	pacified	after	the	emotion	
    outbreak	this	afternoon. And	then –</h5>
    <h5 txt>He	looked	down.</h5>
    <h5 txt>Right	down,	at	the	intersection	of	his	shirt	and	pants.</h5>
    <h5 txt>It	was	an	abnormal size.	Totally	absurd,	but	also	totally	mesmerizing.	He	did	not	remember	that	
    his	testosterone	had	helped	him	so	much	in	previous	occasions	of	such	a	thing	happening,	but	no.	He	
    did	not	know	when	this	had	started, how	long	this	became of,	whatever. All	that	he	knew	is	that	
    something	has	happened	to	little	gimmick,	and	it	is- wet?
    </h5>
    <h5 txt>As	he	slowly	maneuvered	him	next	to	<span class="name2v2">:2</span>, he silently	asked	her	to	– hm. At	first,	both	of	them,	
    like	before,	did	not	speak.	In fact,	neither	of	them	said	a	single	word	until	<span class="name2">:2</span>,	trembling	with	a	mix	of	
    – is	that	excitement	and	uncertainty?	Yes	it	must	be,	says,	“Do	it.”</h5>
    <h5 txt>Later	that	night,	<span class="name2v2">:2</span>	was	sitting	on	the	crunchy	bed	that	<span class="name1v2">:1</span>	owned	with	the	very	anxious
    <span class="name1v2">:1</span>.	He	had	never	tried	this	before,	and	was	verily concerned	about	the	outcome.	But	at	long	last,	the	
    bell	struck	12	inside	<span class="name1v2">:1</span>’s	bedroom.	<span class="name1v2">:1</span>	looked	at	<span class="name2v2">:2</span>,	<span class="name2v2">:2</span>	looked	at	<span class="name1v2">:1</span>.	And	they	both	settled	
    inside	the	rickety	bed. got	under	the	blankets.	<span class="name1v2">:1</span>	turned	the	air	conditioner	off,	and	they	started	
    cooking	some	burgers.</h5>
    <h5 txt>God	knows	what	they	did	under	the	blankets	that	they	put	on	themselves, but	<span class="name1">:1</span>	and	<span class="name2v2">:2</span>,	
    the	first-timers,	surely	were great	at	it.	If	anyone	knocked	up	their	ears	against	the	wall	right	next	to	
    <span class="name1v2">:1</span>’s	bedroom,	you	sure	can	hear	only	one	thing,	but	that	one	thing	is	very	interesting	how	ever.	You	
    could	only,	that	is, hear	the	sounds	of	<span class="name2">:2</span>	moaning	as	she	was	knocked	into	the	five	stages	of	grief	
    and	69	stages	of	pleasure altogether, succumbing	to	the	magnificence	and	happiness	of <span class="name1">:1</span>’s	
    schlong	schtick. Her	counterpart	was	not	feeling	less	of	what	she	is	feeling	on	his	behalf.	The	short	and	
    small	tingling	has	evolved	into	a full-on	throbbing in	every	single	part	of	his	body,	as	he	inadvertently	
    flexed	his	previously	undiscovered	size	on	the	girl	that	he	loved	for	4	years. He	sweated,	he	swore,	he	
    wanted	to	quit	one	time	after	another. His	size	was	of	no	comparison	to	anybody	else,	as	his	brain	
    directed	his	glands	to	release	more	and	more	testosterone.	The	smell	of	yoghurt,	candles,	soap	
    whatsoever	filled	the	incredibly	large	room	compared	to	others	in	<span class="name1v2">:1</span>’s	possession.	They	wrangled	in	
    different	tactics	and	“Tactical	Insertion”	for	several	hours,	and	finally,	FINALLY	they	ended	all	thus	
    actions	just	before	the	sun	was	about	to	rise.	One	may	call	<span class="name1v2">:1</span>	a	long-laster	for	such	a	first	time,	but	
    after	listening	to	Ariana	Grande’s	34+35	(69),	the epiphany	of	“screw	me	until	daylight”	got	to	him	more	
    than	jumping	into	the void	with	no	cookie	buff	and	1	bil	purse	ever	taught	him.</h5>

She was the most beautiful girl I had ever seen. Blonde hair, blue eyes, a smile full of sunshine. Well, that didn’t work too well, she apparently looked down on me because I apparently “stalked her and ate her pasta”? Really I was honestly disappointed I really thought there was a sort of invisible consent that was given. Well I settled for the second best thing available to me, <span class="name2">:2</span>. With a name resembling the o<span class="name2v2">:2</span>es that I choked on in second grade and beady eyes reminiscent of those shiny stones in Thanos’ rock collection. When I asked her out she immediately accepted and fainted on the spot leaving me disgruntled. However the rough start, our relationship progressed smoothly and we soon became drug dealers. A totally perfect duo, we were. Scamming poor children into buying our mashed infinity stones in the morning and snorting crack under the omniscient gaze of the moon in the evening, life was bliss. On our wedding, we had intercourse while high. Then it flew away like a strip of paper caught in the cruel winter wind. She died. A car crash. Right. In. Front. Of. Me. But don’t worry I had a picture of her and and put it into a body pillow. Now fast forward 2 months, I stay huddled whispering manically in front of a screen of anime cat maids holding my <span class="name2">:2</span> body pillow in a dark dusty moldy room in the sahara desert, beating this piece of beef. The End.</h5>

It was the day. <span class="name1">:1</span> had finally turned 18. He can finally stop imagining about it and stop pleasuring himself to the thought of a very special women. <span class="name2">:2</span>. The love of his life, together since sixth grade. They were together at that moment, in a hotel, just waiting for midnight. They had already done their “preparations”. The second it hit 12 AM, they turned off their phones, and without a word, got under the blankets. God knows what they did under there, but <span class="name1">:1</span> surely was great at it. You could only hear the sounds of <span class="name2">:2</span> moaning as she succumbed to the greatness of <span class="name1">:1</span>’s erect “pleasuring device”. His size was no comparison to anyone else, having the ability to make anyone orgasm. The smell of scented candles filled the air, and romantic music with the occasional moan was the only thing audible. On and on they went, until the sun was rising. This continued on and on nearly every single night.</h5><h5 txt>
However, their happiness would not last. In just three years time, World War III had started after the assassination of Ferdinand Franz. This caused great tensions in Europe, and soon, America, where <span class="name1">:1</span> <span class="name2v2">:2</span>ed with his wife, <span class="name2">:2</span>, and four children. However, as many places did not have enough to fight the devastating war, after only four months since the declaration of the war, impressment rules were relaxed, and <span class="name1">:1</span> was among the first batch to get forced to go to the military. There was nothing <span class="name1">:1</span> could do except to watch the tears drip down <span class="name2">:2</span>’s face as they said goodbye to each other, and the four children he would miss so greatly, and the other one on the way. <span class="name1">:1</span> did not receive any training, as everyone was rushing to get more soldiers. He went into war with little to no experience, and he had little contact to the outside world and of course his beloved <span class="name2">:2</span>. During a great battle, the army with <span class="name1">:1</span> in it had been forced to go under radio silence. </h5>
<h5 txt para-start>No communication during this battle. <span class="name2">:2</span> could only anxiously wait and hope that he would make it out of it a<span class="name2v2">:2</span>e. However, <span class="name2">:2</span> soon started feeling contractions. After going to the hospital, she fortunately wasn’t going through labor. She had to wait until <span class="name1">:1</span> arrived back. She had to. </h5><h5 txt>
During this time, <span class="name1">:1</span> was fighting for his life. As he watched his friends and fellow soldiers fall to their death on the battlefield, he started wondering if he would make it out a<span class="name2v2">:2</span>e. Then he thought of <span class="name2">:2</span>, and he felt a little something in between his legs. This distracted him, and he was shot in the right leg. He was immediately rushed to the medic, where they slowly and painfully disinfected him. They realized that his situation was unfortunately worsening, and sent him back to his home to the hospital. Even in his weak state of mind, he was extremely happy, knowing that he would still <span class="name2v2">:2</span>e and see his <span class="name2">:2</span>. However, as he got back to the hospital, his leg was severely infected. <span class="name2">:2</span> visited him, and wanted to pull off his pants and start getting dirty with him, but she couldn’t. She began to worry, as it seemed that the infection was pretty bad. In the end, after many worrisome days and nights, <span class="name1">:1</span> had to get an amputation. Just about when he got on his wheelchair, <span class="name2">:2</span> started feeling contractions again. They rushed to the hospital, and she de<span class="name2v2">:2</span>ered their fifth child. <span class="name1">:1</span> named him O<span class="name2v2">:2</span>er, after <span class="name2">:2</span> and after the o<span class="name2v2">:2</span>e branch, a symbol of peace and tranquility. </h5><h5 txt>
After everything was settled, they got back on the bed again. “Oh! You definitely haven’t lost your power. Oh my! Have you gotten longer?” Those were the desperate words of an overwhelmed <span class="name2">:2</span> as <span class="name1">:1</span> drove through her. Only a week after <span class="name1">:1</span>s arrival, they would be expecting their sixth child. In the end, they would have twelve children in total, but did not stop making love until <span class="name1">:1</span> truly could not do anything. The happy couple <span class="name2v2">:2</span>ed a long prosperous life, both dying on the same day, at the age of 105. </h5>

<h5 txt para-start>
It was under that looming, old oak tree, nearing the end of its life as the fire-red leaves fall to the ground. It was under that oak tree, on a chilly Autumn day, as the animals scurry about looking for food before hiding away for the winter. It was under that oak tree, where a lone, low wooden park bench stood.</h5>
<h5 txt>There sat <span class="name1">:1</span>, alone, a college student with nothing but school on his mind. His life was nothing special. He had no friends to talk to and had very niche interests. He also had no one of romantic interest. Well, that would change very quickly.</h5>
<h5 txt>As he sat on the bench, pondering about the dietary composition of cheesecake and the electron configuration of materials in piss, he saw a woman walk by. He was planning to resume his daydream, but he looked up again. He looked at her waves of hair, at the way the sunset light cast itself onto her side. Then, their eyes met, and <span class="name1v2">:1</span>'s heart lept.</h5>
<h5 txt><i>That must be the most beautiful girl I've ever seen. What am I feeling? I've never felt this emotion for anyone before.</i></h5>
<h5 txt>They held their gaze. <span class="name1v2">:1</span>'s eyes quivered, and he finally looked down at the floor as he felt the color creep up his cheeks. He could feel the mutual attraction. He stood up from the bench and walked towards her, deciding to introduce himself.</h5>
<h5 txt><q>Hey there.</q></h5>
<h5 txt><q>Hi, I'm <span class="name2">:2</span>.</q></h5><h5 id=referencehrline3></h5>
<h5 txt>The rest was all a blur to <span class="name1v2">:1</span>. <span class="name1v2">:1</span> learned that <span class="name2">:2</span> was a transfer student to <span class="name1v2">:1</span>'s school, but the rest was all a blur. They gradually grew closer and closer, helping out each other with homework and studying and playing video games and going to parties together. They passed the semester together, bumping into each other <q>accidentally</q> in the corridors to have an excuse to express their relationship. Half the semester sped by. </h5>
<h5></h5><h5 txt>Finally one day, <span class="name1">:1</span> decided to do it. He took a deep breath, and walked towards <span class="name2">:2</span>. When she caught sight of him, she smiled. <span class="name1v2">:1</span> smiled back, and she pulled her into a hug. "<span class="name1v2">:1</span>," she said, "You look really handsome." <span class="name1v2">:1</span> bled from the nose as <span class="name2">:2</span> felt his muscular upper arms around her. "<span class="name2">:2</span>," he whispered, leaning down to her ear, "You're beautiful." She blushed as she felt his face so close to hers. She ran her fingers through his hair. "Wanna come over to mine after school?" <span class="name1v2">:1</span> asked <span class="name2">:2</span>, smiling a little. "Sure, let's do homework together" <span class="name2">:2</span> responded, giggling.</h5>

<h5 txt>They headed out the library and hitched a ride to <span class="name1v2">:1</span>'s apartment. He showed her the huge apartment he rented in the same building as Charlie and Lola. They played with <span class="name1v2">:1</span>'s cat Lulu, a pure white Persian. Soon, they both started getting tired, and they went up to <span class="name1v2">:1</span>'s bedroom. They got undressed, and lay down. <span class="name1v2">:1</span> kept his face close to her face, and kissed her. "<span class="name1v2">:1</span>," she said, gently pulling on his hair, "I just want to say..." He was distracted by the tickle in his armpit. "What?" he asked. "I just wanted to say, that you're handsome and you smell good" <span class="name2">:2</span> smiled. "Gee, thanks, <span class="name2v2">:2</span>" "Whatever, just you know, I like the fact that you're my boyfriend." <span class="name1v2">:1</span> blushed as he kissed her one last time before heading to bed. <span class="name2">:2</span> followed him, but laid on his right side, facing the wall. Her head fell onto his arm, which she held close to her. They fell asleep quickly.</h5>

<h5 txt><span class="name1v2">:1</span> woke up the next day, lying on his back. He rolled over, and found <span class="name2">:2</span> had left a little note on his pillow. He picked it up, and read the words.</h5>

><span class="name1v2">:1</span>,

>I really hope we can do this again.

>-<span class="name2">:2</span>

<h5 txt><span class="name1v2">:1</span> smiled, and put the note back down. He ate his breakfast, dressed, and left his apartment.

At school, he got bullied yet again for being short. He was beat up by Bill. <span class="name1v2">:1</span> was miserable for rest of the school day, and trudged back to his apartment, petting his cat. 

Then, he received a text from <span class="name2">:2</span>. Just the thought of her cheered up <span class="name1v2">:1</span>, making him happy. The text read, "Don't take those stupid bullies seriously". He smiled, and replied.</h5>

><span class="name2">:2</span>,

>Come over after dinner. I can barely contain my excitement.

>-<span class="name1v2">:1</span>

<h5 txt>After <span class="name1v2">:1</span> watched soccer on TV for an hour, he heard a knock at the door. "Hey, lookee here, there's someone at my door" <span class="name1v2">:1</span> opened the door. "Hiii, <span class="name1v2">:1</span>" <span class="name2">:2</span> said. He nervously smiled at her. "I'm so excited, I just can't hide it. Come on in."</h5>

<h5 txt><span class="name1v2">:1</span> shut the door as <span class="name2">:2</span> walked in. <span class="name2">:2</span> was beautiful, with a short brown dress and a subtle crop-top. They kissed each other passionately and sat on the couch. <span class="name2">:2</span> decided to say it. "Wanna make love?" "Yes!", <span class="name1v2">:1</span> responded.
They undressed, and went to the bedroom. They kissed and passionately rubbed each other's bodies. <span class="name1v2">:1</span> stuffed his long cock down <span class="name2">:2</span>. It got intense and <span class="name1v2">:1</span> came. Then, they both came again. They climaxed, and waited for <span class="name2">:2</span>'s spasm to subside.
They made love twice, which was only normal for <span class="name2">:2</span>, who was so incredibly turned on. 
"<span class="name2">:2</span>," <span class="name1v2">:1</span> asked after he came, "Would you..." but she already had mouthful of sperm. "Not like that." She proceeded to spurt it directly in his face. <span class="name2">:2</span> only smiled. "Yes, like that" <span class="name1v2">:1</span> said to himself. I want to make her feel like that all the time. Soon, after her spasm subsided, <span class="name2">:2</span> finally finished. She masturbated <span class="name1v2">:1</span> into his final ejaculation. They finished off with some sloppy sex.</h5>

<h5 txt><span class="name1v2">:1</span> watched some cartoons, as <span class="name2">:2</span> showered. She came back, and rested in <span class="name1v2">:1</span>'s lap, nuzzling her face against his crotch. After a while, she took a bite of her mango, as <span class="name1v2">:1</span> munched on his chicken. "I hope we can do it again soon. Is it ok if we do? Can we do it whenever we want? Like, whenever we get horny? I'd love to do it as often as I want."</h5>

<h5 txt><span class="name1v2">:1</span> chuckled.</h5>
