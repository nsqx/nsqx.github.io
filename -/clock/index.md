### [Word Clock](https://nsqx.github.io/-/clock/word/?fallback) | [zh-cn](https://nsqx.github.io/-/clock/word/zh-cn/?fallback)
Word Clock is a clock that tells you the time in words, if it wasn't obvious enough in the title. It isn't practical, but it looks cool, I guess, and also works as a clock.

### [Digit Clock](https://nsqx.github.io/-/clock/digit/min?fallback)
Minimal digit clock. What else can I say.
